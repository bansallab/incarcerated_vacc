# Prison Vaccination in a Pandemic: Geographic Disparities and Policy Insights

This repository contains materials for the study: *"Prison Vaccination in a Pandemic: Geographic Disparities and Policy Insights"* by Alexes Merritt and Shweta Bansal (2024). The work explores the geographic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage within incarcerated populations in the United States, highlighting the impact of policy decisions and data gaps.

## Contents

### Notebooks

- **covariate_data_cleaning.ipynb**  
  Prepares and cleans covariate data used for the analysis, including incarceration population metrics and policy variables.

- **vaccination_data_cleaning.ipynb**  
  Processes raw vaccination data, calculates metrics (e.g., vaccination coverage and rates), and organizes data for further analysis.

- **Regression_final.ipynb**  
  Conducts regression modeling to assess the impact of policies such as prioritization, decarceration, and incentivization on vaccination outcomes.

### Data

- **Raw Data**:  
  - 

- **Processed Data**:  
  - Cleaned datasets generated by the `covariate_data_cleaning.ipynb` and `vaccination_data_cleaning.ipynb` notebooks

### Outputs

- Cleaned datasets in CSV format  
- Regression analysis results  
- Visualizations of geographic disparities and policy impacts on vaccination rates
